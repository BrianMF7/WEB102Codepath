# Sea Monster Crowdfunding

Hey there! This is my prework project for WEB102 - a simple web app for Sea Monster's game crowdfunding platform.

## What This Project Does

Sea Monster Crowdfunding helps indie game developers get the money they need to create awesome games. This site shows stats about their funding efforts and lets you browse through the games they've supported.

## Features I Built

- Stats dashboard showing total contributions and funding amounts
- Leaderboard highlighting the most successful crowdfunded games
- Interactive filters to sort games by funding status
- Mobile-friendly design that works on phones and tablets
